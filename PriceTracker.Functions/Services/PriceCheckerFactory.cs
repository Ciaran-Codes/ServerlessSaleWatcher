/*
 * This factory class uses the Service Locator pattern.
 * I know the internet calls it an anti-pattern,
 * but in this case, the alternative is injecting (instantiating)
 * all price checkers into the constructor.
 * If this application grows to support many price checkers,
 * it would cause significant performance issues in terms
 * of speed and memory usage.
 * 
 * I know this is a simple example project,
 * but it just felt wrong to create the factory this way!
 * In real life, I'd probably use attributes ([HandlesDomain("amazon")])
 * and us reflection to auto-map, storing mappings in a dictionary.
 * Or use ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance<T>() to instantiate
 * But at this stage, and with the scope of this project in mind,
 * that would be over-engineering.
 * 
 * Thank you for reading my novel.
 * My conscious is clear and I stand by my decision.
